# Titanic-Dataset-insights-using-python
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset using python and visualized the results.

Its a data science project completed on python jupiter notebook. I use Titanic Dataset from kaggle. 

# Loading and cleaning
I have used the numpy, panda, matplotli.pyplt and seaborn pakages of python.
This data set has some major and minor erros.
There are some duplicate, which has been removed
In **Age** column, there are values many values that are missing. I used the fill method for this set. The statistical methods are not giving the desired results.
There was a outliner in **Fare** coloum that has been removed.

# Visualization
for this project I have created a *bar chart* to see number of age.
I also draw a coorelation matrix for this to see the coorelation of sets.
